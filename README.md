This is a software for debugging my board with ws2811 diodes. 
At this moment my software has some issues,
the main file(tesat.py) is to test how it will eventually work as a program to set
up the color of my RGB diodes and to communicate with SerialPort by UART interface with uC(STM32L476RG in my case).
